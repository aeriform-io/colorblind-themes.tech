## Why colorblind-themes.tech?

Accessibility in the web is becoming far better, but for those of us who code with colourblindness, environment themes are often created without consideration for contrast or colour differentiation. This is a resource to find and encourage creators to consider colourblindness when creating themes.

### What Should I Include?

Add any themes which are accessible for colourblind users, making note of which colourblindness type they support, along with as much detail as possible about the theme (often copied from the marketplace or the theme's website will be plenty rich enough). Imagery is very important here too!

Add any environments which are missing if a theme is supported for that environment.

Update any themes or environments with missing information. Each person will only have 1 type of colorblindness so themes may support more types, or images may be improved. Themes and environments may not always have complete information. Updates are very welcome.

## Adding Themes & environments

* Ensure your data is formatted like other entries
* Ensure images are added to `src/images/themes/[theme-name]`. The more the better.
* Ensure only 1 theme/environment is added per PR. If adding multiple, add environments first and break down into batches.
* Ensure this PR has a descriptive title in the following format
    * ✅ Add [theme]
    * ✅ Add [theme] by [name]
    * ✅ Add [theme] by [@twittername]
    * ❌ Add theme
    * ❌ update

## Code Modifications

* Ensure the code submitted is formatted similarly to existing code
* Ensure variable, method, function, and component names are clear and concise

## Final Requirements

* You've read and understood the above

**Add your name to verify:** Name
